******WARNING******

After running an upgrade, you must manually edit the monitoring-falco ConfigMap
to fix the falcosidekick to be "http://monitoring-falcosidekick:2801"

    kubectl edit configmap monitoring-falco -n monitoring

This is due to a bug that has no current workaround: https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/issues/280
